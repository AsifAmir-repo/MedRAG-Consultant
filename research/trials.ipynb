The physiological consequence is \\nan improved propulsive colonic transportation \\nof the soften stools and a facilitation of the \\ndefecation.

Any unused diluted solution \\nshould be discarded within 24 hours. \\nAdults:\\nConstipation: 25 mL of GOL™ oral solution \\nadded to 100 mL of water once daily (to \\nmake a total volume of 125 mL). This may be \\nincreased to 2 – 3 doses of 25 mL daily (each 25 \\nmL dose added to 100 mL of water), if required \\naccording to individual response. \\nFecal Impaction: 8 doses of 25 mL daily (each 25 \\nmL dose added to 100 mL of water).

Diarrhoea, abdominal \\ndistension, anorectal discomfort and mild \\nvomiting are more often observed during the \\ntreatment for fecal impaction. Vomiting may be \\nresolved if the dose is reduced or delayed.\\nUse In Pregnancy & Lactation\\nClinically, no effects during pregnancy are \\nanticipated, since systemic exposure to \\nMacrogol (3350) is negligible.

Ranolazine may be used \\nwith β-blockers, Nitrates, Calcium channel \\nBlockers, Anti-platelet therapy, lipid-lowering \\ntherapy, ACE inhibitors, & angiotensin receptor \\nblockers. It has been shown to decrease angina \\nepisodes in patients with coronary artery \\ndisease on maximal doses of amlodipine. \\nBecause Ranolazine prolongs the QT interval, \\nit should be reserved for patients who have \\nnot achieved an adequate response with other \\nantianginal drugs.The effect on angina rate or \\nexercise tolerance appeared to be smaller in \\nwomen than men.\\nDosage & Administration\\nInitiate Ranolazine dosing at 500 mg twice \\ndaily & increase to 1 gm twice daily, as needed, \\nbased on clinical symptoms. Take Ranolazine \\nwith or without meals. Ranolazine tablets \\nwhole; do not crush, break or chew.\\nThe maximum recommended daily dose of \\nRanolazine is 1 gm twice daily. If a dose of \\nRanolazine is missed, take the prescribed dose \\nat the next scheduled time; do not double the \\nnext dose.\\nContraindication & Precaution \\nRanolazine is contraindicated in patients:\\n•With pre-existing QT prolongation\\n•With hepatic impairment \\n•Taking QT prolonging drugs\\n•Taking potent & moderately potent CYP3A \\ninhibitors such as Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, \\nClarithromycin, Nefazodone, Nelfinavir, \\nRitonavir, Indinavir, &   Saquinavir, including \\nDiltiazemRanolazine blocks I\\nkr & prolongs the \\nQTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical \\nexperience in an acute coronary syndrome \\npopulation did not show an increased  risk of \\nproarrhythmia or sudden death. \\nCo-administration of Ranolazine with Digoxin \\nincreases the plasma concentrations  of   \\ndigoxin by approximately 1.5 fold & the dose \\nof digoxin may have to be reduced accordingly. \\nThe dose of other P-gp substrates may have \\nto be reduced as well when Ranolazine is co-\\nadministered. Caution should be exercised \\nwhen co-administering Ranolazine with P-gp \\ninhibitors such as Ritonavir or Cyclosporine.\\nR'),\n",

Usual dose is 1 tablet in the morning \\n& 1 tablet in the evening during meals. \\nContraindication & Precaution\\nHistory of hypersensitivity to Ivabradine or any \\nof the excipients, resting heart rate below 60 \\nbpm before treatment, cardiogenic shock, acute \\nmyocardial infarction, severe hypotension \\n(<90/50 mmHg), severe hepatic insufficiency, \\nsick sinus syndrome, sino-atrial block, heart \\nfailure, pacemaker dependent, unstable \\nangina, 3\\nrd degree AV block, combination with \\nstrong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (such \\nas azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, HIV \\nprotease inhibitors). \\nMild to moderate hypotension, Atrial fibrillation, \\nPatients with congenital QT syndrome or \\ntreated with QT wave prolonging medicinal \\nproducts, Moderate hepatic insufficiency, \\nSevere renal insufficiency. \\nSide Effect\\nVisual symptoms, blurred vision, bradycardia, \\n1st degree AV block, ventricular extrasystoles, \\nheadaches, & dizziness. \\nDrug Interaction\\nQT wave prolonging medicinal products is not \\nrecommended.\\n• Cardiovascular QT wave prolonging medicinal \\nproducts (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, \\nbepridil, sotalol, ibutilide, amiodarone). Non \\ncardiovascular QT wave prolonging medicinal \\nproducts (e.g. pimozide, ziprasidone, sertindole, \\nmefloquine, halofantrine, pentamidine, \\ncisapride, intravenous erythromycin). \\n• The concomitant  use  of cardiovascular \\n& non cardiovascular QT wave prolonging \\nmedicinal products with Ivabradine should \\nbe  avoided since QT wave prolongation may \\nbe exacerbated by heart rate reduction.

Ibandronic \\nAcid should be taken at least 60 minutes \\nbefore any oral medications, including \\nmedications containing multivalent cations \\n(such as antacids, supplements or vitamins). \\nAlso, patients should wait at least 60 minutes \\nafter dosing before taking any other oral \\nmedications. \\nCalcium Orotate:Calcium can decrease \\nabsorption of the following drugs when \\ntaken together: Bisphosphonates (e.g., \\nalendronate), Quinolone antibiotics (e.g., \\nciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) and Tetracycline \\nantibiotics (e.g., doxycycline, and minocycline), \\nlevothyroxine, phenytoin (an anticonvulsant) \\nand Tiludronate disodium (to treat Paget’s \\ndisease). Thiazide-type diuretics can interact \\nwith Calcium supplements, increasing the \\nrisks of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. \\nBoth Aluminum and Magnesium containing \\nantacids increase urinary Calcium excretion. \\nMineral oil and stimulant laxatives decrease \\nCalcium absorption. Glucocorticoids can cause \\nCalcium depletion and eventually osteoporosis \\nwhen they are used for months. Oral \\ncontraceptives as well as estrogen compounds \\nreduce Calcium. Anti-inflammatories such as \\nNSAIDs, Aspirin, Ibuprofen deplete Calcium. \\nCorticosteroids deplete Calcium.\\nSide Effects\\nIbandronic Acid:  Common side effects \\ninclude Hypertension, Dyspepsia, Nausea, \\nDiarrhea, Abdominal Pain, Arthralgia, Back \\nPain, Localized Osteoarthritis, Myalgia, Muscle \\nCramp, Influenza, Nasopharyngitis, Bronchitis, \\nUrinary Tract Infection, Upper Respiratory \\nTract Infection, Headache, Dizziness, Skin rash, \\nInsomnia etc.\\nCalcium Orotate:Bloating and swelling in the \\nabdomen are common side effects of Calcium \\nOrotate.
